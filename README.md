# pythonprojects
This repo contains some of the python projects I made for learning and developing my python and coding skills.
They are simple programs with comments explaining the steps and methods that I followed during the coding phase.

1. Alarm Clock: set a time and the program will play a sound at that time. (datetime and playsound module)
2. BMI Calculator: add weight and height in any provided format to calculate the bmi and see the result.
3. Digital Clock: a digital clock providing the current time using Tkinter. (Tkinter, datetime and time module)
4. Rock Paper Scissors: simple game against computer, results at the end.
